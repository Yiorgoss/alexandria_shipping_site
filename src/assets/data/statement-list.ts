            "&emsp;&emsp;The Voyazides family has been part of the Shipping industry ever since Mrs. Alexandra Voyazides’ Grandfather, Leonidas Voyazides, bought his first vessel, Kornilios, before WW1 with his wife’s, Maria Kleanthis Polemis, father. The steamboat Kornilios started what would be a great line of shipowners which have provided continual services to the industry for over a century now. Having thrived for generations and two World Wars, the family has never stopped nor wavered in pursuing and providing their services.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Mrs. Alexandra Voyazides learnt the shipping industry from her dynamic father, Thrasyvoulos Voyazides, who was well known in the maritime industry in Greece and Worldwide. He founded the Transmarine Shipping Agencies Ltd in London in 1957 and was one of the first Greek shipowners who ordered newfangled ships from the shipyards of Japan. Mrs. Voyazides then founded Alexandria Shipping (Hellas) S.A. on the 31st of July 2002 as it was her lifelong dream to start a shipping company of her own. Starting with a single vessel the company now boasts five Bulk Carriers. The organization now consists of skilled and experienced Managers, Operators, Technicians, Engineers and Vessel’s Masters/Officers/Crew as well as specialists in the fields of Safety Management Systems, Commercial Management, Ship Finance, Personnel Management, Legal Matters and Insurance. The Company manages Dry Bulk Carriers and Multi-Purpose Cargo Vessels and operates from the Head Office located in Athens Greece.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Mrs. Voyazides believes in having the best quality ships, thus, always opting for Japanese shipyards for her vessels. To achieve this success Mrs. Voyazides follows the principles her father had passed on to her, it is better to have 7/8 vessels in order to review them often and personally in order to learn the secrets of the trade. This mindset is what has helped this thriving company to form, with the quality and maintenance of the ships always being the highest priority.",
